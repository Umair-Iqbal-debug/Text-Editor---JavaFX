## Description
I created this as my final project for my data structures class, 
therefore it is made with the most efficient data structures like
Binary Search Tree (TreeMap) for the Users. Along with the basic text editor features
it also comes with a Markov-Text Generator which is capable of processing huge
text files such as War and peace and generating text that resembles it.

## Features
* dynamic spell-check
* dynamic input validation
* user authentication
* open and edit text files
* custom CSS style to imitate google form UI
* shortcut-key support for undo
* collapsible format menu 
* status bar to show stats like flesch schore, number of words and sentences
